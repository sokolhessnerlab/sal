        <h1><b>University of Denver - Sokol-Hessner Lab <br> Consent Form for Participation in Research </b></h1>

        <p><b>Title of Research Study:</b> Behavioral &#38; physiological correlates of affect and decision making</p>

        <p><b>Researcher(s):</b> Dr. Peter Sokol-Hessner, University of Denver, Denver, CO 80208 (303-871-3837, Peter.Sokol-Hessner@du.edu)</p>

        <p><b>Study Site:</b> Online Study conducted by the University of Denver</p>

        <p><b><u>Purpose</u></b> <br> You are invited to participate in a research study that examines behavior in the context of decision-making.</p>

        <p><b><u>Procedures</u></b><br> Today’s study is expected to take no more than 1 hour of your time.  </p>
        
        <p><b>Task: Basic Behavior</b><br>You will be asked to do the following:<br><br>
            1)  View and/or respond to visual stimuli on a computer screen (may include words or images that invoke positive or negative emotions, such as the word “fear” or an image of someone crying)</p>
        
        <p><b>Task: Questionnaires &#38; Scales</b><br>
            You will be asked to complete some questionnaires related to the study. Questions may pertain to emotions, social attitudes, substance use, suicide, stress, and/or your experience in this study.</p>
        
        <p>You will be asked to complete some questionnaires related to the study. We will also ask you to provide some general demographic information about yourself. This information may include your age, gender, race, education, etc.</p>

        <p><b><u>Voluntary Participation</u></b><br>
            Participating in this research study is completely voluntary. Even if you initially decide to participate, you may change your mind and stop participation at any time. You may choose not to complete any survey question, and you may withdraw from the study at any time, including before, during, or after any tasks, for any reason and without explanation, and you will still be compensated at the specified hourly rate. </p>
        
        <p><b><u>Risks or Discomforts</u></b><br>
            Potential risks and/or discomforts of participation are generally minimal (meaning no more than you might experience in an average day), and may include:</p>
        
        <p><b>Tasks (incl. basic behavioral, risky decision-making, signal detection, and emotion regulation)</b><br>
            -	Mild boredom, fatigue, or frustration during a cognitive task<br>
            -	Embarrassment, distress, or discomfort when viewing emotional stimuli (e.g. images). As a reminder, your participation is voluntary and may be discontinued at any time. </p>
        <p><b>Task: Questionnaires and tasks regarding social groups</b><br>
            -	You may experience discomfort and/or distress when responding to or answering questions about other people or social groups. As a reminder, your participation is voluntary and may be discontinued at any time.</p>
        
        <p>Some people find answering questions about their life events distressing or embarrassing. If you become uncomfortable, and remain upset after 48 hours as a result of completing any part of the experiment, such as questionnaires that may cover some sensitive topics including your mental health, you should take one of the following actions: (1) arrange a timely appointment with your physician, clinical psychologist or psychiatrist; or if you are having suicidal thoughts (2) call 911 or visit a hospital emergency room or urgent care center, or (3) please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (<i>1-800-273-8255</i>).</p>
        
        <p>There is also a slight risk of unintended breach of confidentiality. Please see confidentiality section below for more details.</p>
        
        <p><b><u>Benefits</u></b><br>
            Possible benefits of participation include contributing to current scientific knowledge about how people feel, respond, and make decisions under certain conditions. This study is not designed to treat any illness or provide any positive health benefits for those who participate.</p>
        
        <p><b><u>Incentives to Participate</u></b><br>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
            
            <p>For this task, you'll be learning about multiple people by reading through a series of two-sentence stories, or "vignettes," and answering questions about your feelings toward them. </p>
            
            <p>Vignettes will be presented <b>one sentence at a time</b>, for 4 seconds each. You will read the first sentence, then the second sentence, and then answer two questions, one at a time, which will ask you about your feelings about the person, taking into consideration what you have just learned about them. <b>For each of these two questions, you will have 10 seconds to make your response.</b> If you do not respond within the allotted amount of time, the task will move forward and your answer will not be recorded. </p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
                        
        <p>You will always answer the same two questions after every vignette. First, you will answer how <b>likable</b> you find this person to be. Likable refers to how appealing you find this person, or how positively you perceive him to be.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        
        <p>For the second question, you will be asked how much you'd <b>like to connect</b> with the person. Connect here refers to how much you'd like to spend time with this person, get to know them better, or otherwise interact with them. </p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        
        <p>For each person, it is important that you treat each thing you learn as <b>adding to your conception of this person.</b> Each vignette is intended to give you more information about that one person, and each item you learn should help you build a deeper understanding of the person you are learning about.</p>

        <h1>Debrief</h1>
            
        <p>Thank you for taking part in this study. The purpose of the task is to understand how the things that people learn about someone - and the order in which we learn those things - influences our desire to connect. We also wanted to see whether the things we learn about someone result in differences in the types of connections we wish to have with them. To measure social connection, we drew from current theories in the field of social psychology that define social connection along two dimensions - affiliation (intimacy, trustworthiness) and power (dominance, hierarchy). In this task, we are also testing whether there is evidence for a possible third dimension, value, which measures the extent to which one benefits from a particular social connection.</p>
            
        <p>During this task, we had you learn about 12 characters, each of whom had names and faces randomly matched up with a series of vignettes that fell along two dimensions: valence (whether the vignette was positive or negative) and attribution (whether the behavior described in the vignette was caused by the situation or by the character's disposition). For some characters, the dimensions of the vignettes did not change (for example, all 10 vignettes were positive and situational). In other characters, one or both of the dimensions changed after the first 5 vignettes. By keeping some characters consistent and having others shift, we can look at how desire to connect with a person changes when the things we learn about them change.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to asking how your desire to connect changes on a vignette by vignette basis, we also asked general questions about your feelings toward each character to get a sense for how all of the information learned informs a general conception of the character, as well as the specific types of connections you may be interested in. In order to obtain a baseline understanding for how each participant's individual desires for social connection may factor into their feelings and decisions, we also asked general questions about how much you want to connect with others and the types of connections you tend to value.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, our goal with this study is to deepen our understanding of how we form social connections and the different types of connections we can choose to have with others. Your participation in this task helps us gather information about how people may use social information in choosing with whom to affiliate.</p>
