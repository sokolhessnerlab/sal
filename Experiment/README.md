Social Affiliation + Learning Study (Pilot)

## Study Design (Updated 04/2020)

Current design of the study:
- Design of study heavily borrows from Brosch (2013), and also looks pretty similar to Mende-Siedlecki (2013)
- Participants learn about 12 characters with random milquetoast masculine names (blocks)
- Each character has 10 vignettes about them (10 trials/block)
- Each vignette has two dimensions, valence (pos/neg) and attribution (situational/dispositional) and contains two sentences (action and context).
- Of the 12 blocks:
        - 4 of them are "controls" (eg. Positive + Situational)
        - 8 of them are "shifts" - Start at one Valence and one Attribution type, and one or both dimensions switch halfway through the task.
- At the end of each block, participants answer questions about their feelings toward the character.
- At the end of all 12 blocks, participants answer general questions about their feelings toward social affiliation + more questions about the characters in isolation/in relation to each other. Also ask a couple memory check questions, just to make sure they haven't completely forgotten. (But also, to see how interesting it would be to look at who is more memorable!)
- Each sentence of the vignette is intended to be presented one at a time. Order of sentences (action or context) randomized for each vignette.
- Each sentence is displayed for 4 seconds. Fixation cross displayed for 1 second.
- Then 2 analog scale questions, one at a time: 
        - How likable is this person? 
        - How much would you like to connect with this person? 
- 10 seconds to respond for each - after 10 seconds of no response, the task skips to the next question/next trial. Otherwise, the task moves forward immediately upon receiving a response.
- Estimated time to complete: 1 hour.

## Vignette Development + Norming (09/2019 - 02/2020)
- Vignettes originally obtained from Tobias Brosch, previously used in his paper Brosch et al (2013)
- Edited to remove names, changed all to masculine pronouns. Other edits include slight changes to content in order to fit dimensions (Valence - Pos/Neg, Attribution - Sit/Disp). Additional vignettes were written up to fill out each dimension. 130 were written up in total.
- Three rounds of norming and editing completed - 1 internal, 2 on SONA.

## Piloting (04/2020 - Present)

### Round 1
- 19 participants collected on SONA
